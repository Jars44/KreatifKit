# KreatifKit

A Vite project with Tailwind CSS, using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bun as package manager.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `bun install` to install dependencies. This installs `tailwindcss` and the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin so the Vite plugin can inject Tailwind during dev.

### Development

Run `bun run dev` to start the development server (this uses Vite and `@tailwindcss/vite`).

### Build

Run `bun run build` to build for production.

### Preview

Run `bun run preview` to preview the production build.
